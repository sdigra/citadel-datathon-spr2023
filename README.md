## Citadel Data Open Midwest Regional Spring 2023
Our team's submission to the Sprgin 2023 Citadel Midwest Regional Datathon. This competition was virtual and ran from February 5, 2023 - February 12, 2023. We analyzed the relationship between greenspace and mental health while factoring in varied income through a regression model. We also explored the relationship between increased gentrification in places with increased public spending on greenspace.
